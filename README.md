# WoWChatHardcore
Recomp of a bot from [@fjaros](https://github.com/fjaros/wowchat) with added functionalities for the use on the Frostmourne of Stormforge.gg.
I modified a few things like:
* Filters to remove certains chars only found on this server
* A "Who's Online?" feature that updates a message in Discord to see who are online in real time.
* Etc.
